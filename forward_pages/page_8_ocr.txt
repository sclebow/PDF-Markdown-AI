Note: The material prices in RSMeans cost data
are "contractor's prices." They are the prices that
contractors can expect to pay at the lumberyards,
suppliers'/distributors' warehouses, etc. Small
orders of specialty items would be higher than
the costs shown, while very large orders, such as
truckload lots, would be less. The variation would
depend on the size, timing, and negotiating power
of the contractor. The labor costs are primarily
for new construction or major renovation rather
than repairs or minor alterations. With reasonable
exercise of judgment, the figures can be used for
any building work.
