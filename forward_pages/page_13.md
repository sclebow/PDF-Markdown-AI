that can be transported by hand) of up to 200' into the building and to the first or second floor is also included. If material has to be transported by other means, over greater distances, or to higher floors, an additional allowance should be considered by the estimator.  
While horizontal movement is typically a sole function of distances, vertical transport introduces other variables that can significantly impact productivity. In an occupied building, the use of elevators (assuming access, size, and required protective measures are acceptable) must be understood at the time of the estimate. For new construction, hoist wait and cycle times can easily be 15 minutes and may result in scheduled access extending beyond the normal work day. Finally, all vertical transport will impose strict weight limits likely to preclude the use of any motorized material handling.  
The productivity, or daily output, also assumes installation that meets manufacturer/designer/standard specifications. A time allowance for quality control checks, minor adjustments, and any task required to ensure proper function or operation is also included. For items that require connections to services, time is included for positioning, leveling, securing the unit, and making all the necessary connections (and start up where applicable) to ensure a complete installation. Estimating of the services themselves (electrical, plumbing, water, steam, hydraulics, dust collection, etc.) is separate.  
In some cases, the estimator must consider the use of a crane and an appropriate crew for the installation of large or heavy items. For those situations where a crane is not included in the assigned crew and as part of the line item cost, then equipment rental costs, mobilization and demobilization costs, and operator and support personnel costs must be considered.

### Labor-Hours

The labor-hours expressed in this publication are derived by dividing the total daily labor-hours for the crew by the daily output. Based on average installation time and the assumptions listed above, the labor-hours include: direct labor, indirect labor, and nonproductive time. A typical day for a craftsman might include but is not limited to:

**Direct Work**  
Measuring and layout  
Preparing materials  
Actual installation  
Quality assurance/quality control  

**Indirect Work**  
Reading plans or specifications  
Preparing space  
Receiving materials  
□ Material movement  
☐  
Giving or receiving instruction  
Miscellaneous  

**Non-Work**  
□ Chatting  
口 Personal issues  
O Breaks  
Interruptions (i.e., sickness, weather, material or equipment shortages, etc.)

If any of the items for a typical day do not apply to the particular work or project situation, the estimator should make any necessary adjustments.

### Final Checklist

Estimating can be a straightforward process provided you remember the basics. Here's a checklist of some of the steps you should remember to complete before finalizing your estimate.

Did you remember to:  
- factor in the City Cost Index for your locale?  
- take into consideration which items have been marked up and by how much?  
- mark up the entire estimate sufficiently for your purposes?  
- read the background information on techniques and technical matters that could impact your project time span and cost?  
- include all components of your project in the final estimate?  
- ■ double check your figures for accuracy?  
- ■ call RSMeans data engineers if you have any questions about your estimate or the data you've used?  

Remember, Gordian stands behind all of our products, including our extensive RSMeans data solutions. If you have any questions about your estimate, about the costs you've used from our data, or even about the technical aspects of the job that may affect your estimate, feel free to call the Gordian RSMeans editors at 1.800.448.8182.
