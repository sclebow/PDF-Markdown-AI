Estimating with RSMeans data:
Unit Prices
Following these steps will allow you to complete
an accurate estimate using RSMeans data:
Unit Prices.
1. Scope Out the Project
Think through the project and identify the CSI
divisions needed in your estimate.
■ Identify the individual work tasks that will
need to be covered in your estimate.
The Unit Price data have been divided into
50 divisions according to CSI MasterFormatⓇ
2018.
In printed versions, the Unit Price Section
Table of Contents on page 1 may also be
helpful when scoping out your project.
■ Experienced estimators find it helpful to
begin with Division 2 and continue through
completion. Division 1 can be estimated after
the full project scope is known.
2. Quantify
Determine the number of units required for
each work task that you identified.
■ Experienced estimators include an allowance
for waste in their quantities. (Waste is not
included in our Unit Price line items unless
otherwise stated.)
3. Price the Quantities
Use the search tools available to locate
individual Unit Price line items for your
estimate.
Reference Numbers indicated within a Unit
Price section refer to additional information
that you may find useful.
The crew indicates who is performing the
work for that task. Crew codes are expanded
in the Crew Listings in the Reference Section
to include all trades and equipment that
comprise the crew.
The Daily Output is the amount of work the
crew is expected to complete in one day.
The Labor-Hours value is the amount of time
it will take for the crew to install one unit of
work.
The abbreviated Unit designation indicates
the unit of measure upon which the crew,
productivity, and prices are based.
Bare Costs are shown for materials, labor, and
equipment needed to complete the Unit Price
line item. Bare costs do not include waste,
project overhead, payroll insurance, payroll
taxes, main office overhead, or profit.
The Total Incl O&P cost is the billing rate or
invoice amount of the installing contractor or
subcontractor who performs the work for the
Unit Price line item.
4. Multiply
■Multiply the total number of units needed
for
your project by the Total Incl O&P cost for
each Unit Price line item.
Be careful that your take off unit of measure
matches the unit of measure in the Unit
column.
The price you calculate is an estimate for a
completed item of work.
■ Keep scoping individual tasks, determining
the number of units required for those tasks,
matching each task with individual Unit Price
line items, and multiplying quantities by Total
Incl O&P costs.
An estimate completed in this manner
is priced as if a subcontractor, or set of
subcontractors, is performing the work.
The estimate does not yet include Project
Overhead or Estimate Summary components
such as general contractor markups on
subcontracted work, general contractor
office overhead and profit, contingency, and
Location factors.
5. Project Overhead
Include project overhead items from Division
1-General Requirements.
These items are needed to make the job run.
They are typically, but not always, provided
by the general contractor. Items include,
but are not limited to, field personnel,
insurance, performance bond, permits,
testing, temporary utilities, field office and
storage facilities, temporary scaffolding
and platforms, equipment mobilization
and demobilization, temporary roads and
sidewalks, winter protection, temporary
barricades and fencing, temporary security,
temporary signs, field engineering and layout,
final cleaning, and commissioning.
Each item should be quantified and matched
to individual Unit Price line items in Division
1, then priced and added to your estimate.
An alternate method of estimating project
overhead costs is to apply a percentage of the
total project cost-usually 5% to 15% with an
average of 10% (see General Conditions).
■Include other project related expenses in your
estimate such as:
ㅁ
Rented equipment not itemized in the
Crew Listings
ㅁ Rubbish handling throughout the project
(see section 02 41 19.19)
6. Estimate Summary
Include sales tax as required by laws of your
state or county.
Include the general contractor's markup on
self-performed work, usually 5% to 15% with
an average of 10%.
Include the general contractor's markup on
subcontracted work, usually 5% to 15% with
an average of 10%.
Include the general contractor's main office
overhead and profit:
口
RSMeans data provides general guidelines
on the general contractor's main office
overhead (see section 01 31 13.60 and
Reference Number R013113-50).
Markups will depend on the size of the
general contractor's operations, projected
annual revenue, the level of risk, and the
level of competition in the local area and
for this project in particular.
■Include a contingency, usually 3% to 5%, if
appropriate.
■ Adjust your estimate to the project's location
by using the City Cost Indexes or the Location
Factors in the Reference Section:
Look at the rules in "How to Use the City
Cost Indexes" to see how to apply the
Indexes for your location.
When the proper Index or Factor has
been identified for the project's location,
convert it to a multiplier by dividing it
by 100, then multiply that multiplier by
your estimated total cost. The original
estimated total cost will now be adjusted
up or down from the national average to a
total that is appropriate for your location.

They
are
typically

overhead
(
see
section

.
Markups
will
depend
on
the
size
of
the
general
contractor's
operations
,
projected
annual
revenue
,
the
level
of
risk
,
and
the
level

in
"
How
