How the Cost Data Is Built:
An Overview
Unit Prices*
All cost data have been divided into 50 divisions
according to the MasterFormatⓇ system of
classification and numbering.
Assemblies*
The cost data in this section have been organized
in an "Assemblies" format. These assemblies
are the functional elements of a building and
are arranged according to the 7 elements of
the UNIFORMAT II classification system. For a
complete explanation of a typical "Assembly",
see "RSMeans data: Assemblies-How They
Work."
Residential Models*
Model buildings for four classes of construction-
economy, average, custom, and luxury-are
developed and shown with complete costs per
square foot.
Commercial/Industrial/
Institutional Models*
This section contains complete costs for 77
typical model buildings expressed as costs per
square foot.
Green Commercial/Industrial/
Institutional Models*
This section contains complete costs for 25 green
model buildings expressed as costs per square
foot.

Rental Costs, Crew Listings, Historical Cost
