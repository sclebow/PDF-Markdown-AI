How to Use the Cost Data:
The Details
What's Behind the Numbers?
The Development of Cost Data
RSMeans data engineers continually monitor
developments in the construction industry
to ensure reliable, thorough, and up-to-date
cost information. While overall construction
costs may vary relative to general economic
conditions, price fluctuations within the industry
are dependent upon many factors. Individual
price variations may, in fact, be opposite to
overall economic trends. Therefore, costs are
constantly tracked and complete updates are
performed yearly. Also, new items are frequently
added in response to changes in materials and
methods.
Costs in U.S. Dollars
All costs represent U.S. national averages and
are given in U.S. dollars. The City Cost Index
(CCI) with RSMeans data can be used to adjust
costs to a particular location. The CCI for Canada
can be used to adjust U.S. national averages to
local costs in Canadian dollars. No exchange rate
conversion is necessary because it has already
been factored in.
G
The processes or products identified by
the green symbol in our publications
have been determined to be environmentally
responsible and/or resource-efficient solely by
RSMeans data engineering staff. The inclusion of
the green symbol does not represent compliance
with any specific industry association or
standard.
Material Costs
RSMeans data engineers contact manufacturers,
dealers, distributors, and contractors all across
the U.S. and Canada to determine national
average material costs. If you have access
to current material costs for your specific
location, you may wish to make adjustments to
reflect differences from the national average.
Included within material costs are fasteners for
a normal installation. RSMeans data engineers
use manufacturers' recommendations, written
specifications, and/or standard construction
practices for the sizing and spacing of fasteners.
Adjustments to material costs may be required
for your specific application or location. The
manufacturer's warranty is assumed. Extended
warranties are not included in the material costs.
Material costs do not include sales tax.
Labor Costs
Labor costs are based upon a mathematical
average of trade-specific wages in 30 major
U.S. cities. The type of wage (union, open shop,
or residential) is identified on the inside back
cover of printed publications or selected by the
estimator when using the electronic products.
Markups for the wages can also be found on
the inside back cover of printed publications
and/or under the labor references found in the
electronic products.
If wage rates in your area vary from those
used, or if rate increases are expected within
a given year, labor costs should be adjusted
accordingly.
Labor costs reflect productivity based on
actual working conditions. In addition to actual
installation, these figures include time spent
during a normal weekday on tasks, such as
material receiving and handling, mobilization at
the site, site movement, breaks, and cleanup.
Productivity data is developed over an extended
period so as not to be influenced by abnormal
variations and reflects a typical average.
Equipment Costs
Equipment costs include not only rental but also
operating costs for equipment under normal
use. The operating costs include parts and
labor for routine servicing, such as the repair
and replacement of pumps, filters, and worn
lines. Normal operating expendables, such as
fuel, lubricants, tires, and electricity (where
applicable), are also included. Extraordinary
operating expendables with highly variable
wear patterns, such as diamond bits and
blades, are excluded. These costs are included
under materials. Equipment rental rates are
obtained from industry sources throughout
North America-contractors, suppliers, dealers,
manufacturers, and distributors.
Rental rates can also be treated as
reimbursement costs for contractor-owned
equipment. Owned equipment costs include
depreciation, loan payments, interest, taxes,
insurance, storage, and major repairs.
Equipment costs do not include operators'
wages.
Equipment Cost/Day-The cost of equipment
required for each crew is included in the Crew
Listings in the Reference Section (small tools
that are considered essential everyday tools are
not listed out separately). The Crew Listings
itemize specialized tools and heavy equipment
along with labor trades. The daily cost of
itemized equipment included in a crew is based
on dividing the weekly bare rental rate by 5
(number of working days per week), then adding
the hourly operating cost times 8 (the number
of hours per day). This Equipment Cost/Day
is shown in the last column of the Equipment
Rental Costs in the Reference Section.
Mobilization, Demobilization-The cost to move
construction equipment from an equipment yard
or rental company to the job site and back again
is not included in equipment costs. Mobilization
(to the site) and demobilization (from the site)
costs can be found in the Unit Price Section. If
a piece of equipment is already at the job site,
it is not appropriate to utilize mobilization or
demobilization costs again in an estimate.
Overhead and Profit
Total Cost including O&P for the installing
contractor is shown in the last column of the Unit
Price and/or Assemblies. This figure is the sum
of the bare material cost plus 10% for profit, the
bare labor cost plus total overhead and profit,
and the bare equipment cost plus 10% for profit.
Details for the calculation of overhead and profit
on labor are shown on the inside back cover of
the printed product and in the Reference Section
of the electronic product.
General Conditions
Cost data in this data set are presented in two
ways: Bare Costs and Total Cost including O&P
(Overhead and Profit). General Conditions, or
General Requirements, of the contract should
also be added to the Total Cost including O&P
when applicable. Costs for General Conditions
are listed in Division 1 of the Unit Price Section
and in the Reference Section.
General Conditions for the installing contractor
may range from 0% to 10% of the Total
Cost including O&P. For the general or prime
contractor, costs for General Conditions may
range from 5% to 15% of the Total Cost including
O&P, with a figure of 10% as the most typical
allowance. If applicable, the Assemblies and
Models sections use costs that include the
installing contractor's overhead and profit (O&P).

-
specific
wages
in
30
major
U.S.
cities
.
The
type
of
wage
(
union
,

or
residential
)
is
identified
on
the
inside
back
cover
of
printed

If
wage
rates
in
your
area
vary
from
those
used
,
or
if
rate
increases
are
expected
within
a
given
year
,
labor
costs
should
be
adjusted
accordingly
.
Labor
costs
reflect
productivity
based
on
actual
working
conditions
.
In
addition
to
actual
installation
,
these
figures
include
time
spent
during
a
normal
weekday
on
tasks
,
such
as
material
receiving

Productivity
data
is
developed

so
as
not
to
be
influenced
by
abnormal
variations
and
reflects
a
typical
average
.
Equipment

Equipment
Cost
/
Day
-
The
cost
of
equipment
required
for
each
crew
is
included
in
the
Crew
Listings
in
the
Reference
Section
(
small
tools
that
are
considered
essential
everyday
tools
are
not
listed
out
separately
)
.
The
Crew
Listings
itemize
specialized
tools
and
heavy
equipment
along
with
labor
trades
.
The
daily
cost
of
itemized
equipment
included
in
a
crew
is
based
on
dividing
the
weekly
bare
rental
rate
by
5
(
number
of
working
days
per
week
)
,
then
adding
the
hourly
operating
cost
times
8
(
the
