      "Unit Prices\n",
      "\n",
      "Following these steps will allow you to complete an accurate estimate using RSMeans data: Unit Prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Scope Out the Project  \n",
      "Think through the project and identify the CSI divisions needed in your estimate.  \n",
      "■ Identify the individual work tasks that will need to be covered in your estimate.  \n",
      "The Unit Price data have been divided into 50 divisions according to CSI MasterFormatⓇ 2018.  \n",
      "In printed versions, the Unit Price Section Table of Contents on page 1 may also be helpful when scoping out your project.  \n",
      "■ Experienced estimators find it helpful to begin with Division 2 and continue through completion. Division 1 can be estimated after the full project scope is known.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Quantify  \n",
      "Determine the number of units required for each work task that you identified.  \n",
      "■ Experienced estimators include an allowance for waste in their quantities. (Waste is not included in our Unit Price line items unless otherwise stated.)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Price the Quantities  \n",
      "Use the search tools available to locate individual Unit Price line items for your estimate.  \n",
      "Reference Numbers indicated within a Unit Price section refer to additional information that you may find useful.  \n",
      "The crew indicates who is performing the work for that task. Crew codes are expanded in the Crew Listings in the Reference Section to include all trades and equipment that comprise the crew.  \n",
      "The Daily Output is the amount of work the crew is expected to complete in one day.  \n",
      "The Labor-Hours value is the amount of time it will take for the crew to install one unit of work.  \n",
      "The abbreviated Unit designation indicates the unit of measure upon which the crew, productivity, and prices are based.  \n",
      "Bare Costs are shown for materials, labor, and equipment needed to complete the Unit Price line item. Bare costs do not include waste, project overhead, payroll insurance, payroll taxes, main office overhead, or profit.  \n",
      "The Total Incl O&P cost is the billing rate or invoice amount of the installing contractor or subcontractor who performs the work for the Unit Price line item.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Multiply  \n",
      "■ Multiply the total number of units needed for your project by the Total Incl O&P cost for each Unit Price line item.  \n",
      "Be careful that your take off unit of measure matches the unit of measure in the Unit column.  \n",
      "The price you calculate is an estimate for a completed item of work.  \n",
      "■ Keep scoping individual tasks, determining the number of units required for those tasks, matching each task with individual Unit Price line items, and multiplying quantities by Total Incl O&P costs.  \n",
      "An estimate completed in this manner is priced as if a subcontractor, or set of subcontractors, is performing the work.  \n",
      "The estimate does not yet include Project Overhead or Estimate Summary components such as general contractor markups on subcontracted work, general contractor office overhead and profit, contingency, and Location factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Project Overhead  \n",
      "Include project overhead items from Division 1-General Requirements.  \n",
      "These items are needed to make the job run. They are typically, but not always, provided by the general contractor. Items include, but are not limited to, field personnel, insurance, performance bond, permits, testing, temporary utilities, field office and storage facilities, temporary scaffolding and platforms, equipment mobilization and demobilization, temporary roads and sidewalks, winter protection, temporary barricades and fencing, temporary security, temporary signs, field engineering and layout, final cleaning, and commissioning.  \n",
      "Each item should be quantified and matched to individual Unit Price line items in Division 1, then priced and added to your estimate.  \n",
      "An alternate method of estimating project overhead costs is to apply a percentage of the total project cost-usually 5% to 15% with an average of 10% (see General Conditions).  \n",
      "■ Include other project related expenses in your estimate such as:  \n",
      "ㅁ Rented equipment not itemized in the Crew Listings  \n",
      "ㅁ Rubbish handling throughout the project (see section 02 41 19.19)\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Estimate Summary  \n",
      "Include sales tax as required by laws of your state or county.  \n",
      "Include the general contractor's markup on self-performed work, usually 5% to 15% with an average of 10%.  \n",
      "Include the general contractor's markup on subcontracted work, usually 5% to 15% with an average of 10%.  \n",
      "Include the general contractor's main office overhead and profit:  \n",
      "口 RSMeans data provides general guidelines on the general contractor's main office overhead (see section 01 31 13.60 and Reference Number R013113-50).  \n",
      "Markups will depend on the size of the general contractor's operations, projected annual revenue, the level of risk, and the level of competition in the local area and for this project in particular.  \n",
      "■ Include a contingency, usually 3% to 5%, if appropriate.  \n",
      "■ Adjust your estimate to the project's location by using the City Cost Indexes or the Location Factors in the Reference Section:  \n",
      "Look at the rules in \"How to Use the City Cost Indexes\" to see how to apply the Indexes for your location.  \n",
      "When the proper Index or Factor has been identified for the project's location, convert it to a multiplier by dividing it by 100, then multiply that multiplier by your estimated total cost. The original estimated total cost will now be adjusted up or down from the national average to a total that is appropriate for your location.\n",

      "The Details\n",
      "What's Behind the Numbers?\n",
      "The Development of Cost Data\n",
      "RSMeans data engineers continually monitor\n",
      "developments in the construction industry\n",
      "to ensure reliable, thorough, and up-to-date\n",
      "cost information. While overall construction\n",
      "costs may vary relative to general economic\n",
      "conditions, price fluctuations within the industry\n",
      "are dependent upon many factors. Individual\n",
      "price variations may, in fact, be opposite to\n",
      "overall economic trends. Therefore, costs are\n",
      "constantly tracked and complete updates are\n",
      "performed yearly. Also, new items are frequently\n",
      "added in response to changes in materials and\n",
      "methods.\n",
      "Costs in U.S. Dollars\n",
      "All costs represent U.S. national averages and\n",
      "are given in U.S. dollars. The City Cost Index\n",
      "(CCI) with RSMeans data can be used to adjust\n",
      "costs to a particular location. The CCI for Canada\n",
      "can be used to adjust U.S. national averages to\n",
      "local costs in Canadian dollars. No exchange rate\n",
      "conversion is necessary because it has already\n",
      "been factored in.\n",
      "G\n",
      "The processes or products identified by\n",
      "the green symbol in our publications\n",
      "have been determined to be environmentally\n",
      "responsible and/or resource-efficient solely by\n",
      "RSMeans data engineering staff. The inclusion of\n",
      "the green symbol does not represent compliance\n",
      "with any specific industry association or\n",
      "standard.\n",
      "Material Costs\n",
      "RSMeans data engineers contact manufacturers,\n",
      "dealers, distributors, and contractors all across\n",
      "the U.S. and Canada to determine national\n",
      "average material costs. If you have access\n",
      "to current material costs for your specific\n",
      "location, you may wish to make adjustments to\n",
      "reflect differences from the national average.\n",
      "Included within material costs are fasteners for\n",
      "a normal installation. RSMeans data engineers\n",
      "use manufacturers' recommendations, written\n",
      "specifications, and/or standard construction\n",
      "practices for the sizing and spacing of fasteners.\n",
      "Adjustments to material costs may be required\n",
      "for your specific application or location. The\n",
      "manufacturer's warranty is assumed. Extended\n",
      "warranties are not included in the material costs.\n",
      "Material costs do not include sales tax.\n",
      "Labor Costs\n",
      "Labor costs are based upon a mathematical\n",
      "average of trade-specific wages in 30 major\n",

      "### The Development of Cost Data\n",
      "\n",
      "RSMeans data engineers continually monitor developments in the construction industry to ensure reliable, thorough, and up-to-date cost information. While overall construction costs may vary relative to general economic conditions, price fluctuations within the industry are dependent upon many factors. Individual price variations may, in fact, be opposite to overall economic trends. Therefore, costs are constantly tracked and complete updates are performed yearly. Also, new items are frequently added in response to changes in materials and methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Costs in U.S. Dollars\n",
      "\n",
      "All costs represent U.S. national averages and are given in U.S. dollars. The City Cost Index (CCI) with RSMeans data can be used to adjust costs to a particular location. The CCI for Canada can be used to adjust U.S. national averages to local costs in Canadian dollars. No exchange rate conversion is necessary because it has already been factored in.\n",
      "\n",
      "G  \n",
      "The processes or products identified by the green symbol in our publications have been determined to be environmentally responsible and/or resource-efficient solely by RSMeans data engineering staff. The inclusion of the green symbol does not represent compliance with any specific industry association or standard.\n",

      "\n",
      "RSMeans data engineers contact manufacturers, dealers, distributors, and contractors all across the U.S. and Canada to determine national average material costs. If you have access to current material costs for your specific location, you may wish to make adjustments to reflect differences from the national average. Included within material costs are fasteners for a normal installation. RSMeans data engineers use manufacturers' recommendations, written specifications, and/or standard construction practices for the sizing and spacing of fasteners. Adjustments to material costs may be required for your specific application or location. The manufacturer's warranty is assumed. Extended warranties are not included in the material costs. Material costs do not include sales tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Labor Costs\n",
      "\n",
      "Labor costs are based upon a mathematical average of trade-specific wages in 30 major U.S. cities. The type of wage (union, open shop, or residential) is identified on the inside back cover of printed publications or selected by the estimator when using the electronic products. Markups for the wages can also be found on the inside back cover of printed publications and/or under the labor references found in the electronic products.\n",
      "\n",
      "If wage rates in your area vary from those used, or if rate increases are expected within a given year, labor costs should be adjusted accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labor costs reflect productivity based on actual working conditions. In addition to actual installation, these figures include time spent during a normal weekday on tasks, such as material receiving and handling, mobilization at the site, site movement, breaks, and cleanup. Productivity data is developed over an extended period so as not to be influenced by abnormal variations and reflects a typical average.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Equipment Costs\n",
      "\n",
      "Equipment costs include not only rental but also operating costs for equipment under normal use. The operating costs include parts and labor for routine servicing, such as the repair and replacement of pumps, filters, and worn lines. Normal operating expendables, such as fuel, lubricants, tires, and electricity (where applicable), are also included. Extraordinary operating expendables with highly variable wear patterns, such as diamond bits and blades, are excluded. These costs are included under materials. Equipment rental rates are obtained from industry sources throughout North America—contractors, suppliers, dealers, manufacturers, and distributors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rental rates can also be treated as reimbursement costs for contractor-owned equipment. Owned equipment costs include depreciation, loan payments, interest, taxes, insurance, storage, and major repairs. Equipment costs do not include operators' wages.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Equipment Cost/Day**—The cost of equipment required for each crew is included in the Crew Listings in the Reference Section (small tools that are considered essential everyday tools are not listed out separately). The Crew Listings itemize specialized tools and heavy equipment along with labor trades. The daily cost of itemized equipment included in a crew is based on dividing the weekly bare rental rate by 5 (number of working days per week), then adding the hourly operating cost times 8 (the number of hours per day). This Equipment Cost/Day is shown in the last column of the Equipment Rental Costs in the Reference Section.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mobilization, Demobilization**—The cost to move construction equipment from an equipment yard or rental company to the job site and back again is not included in equipment costs. Mobilization (to the site) and demobilization (from the site) costs can be found in the Unit Price Section. If a piece of equipment is already at the job site, it is not appropriate to utilize mobilization or demobilization costs again in an estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overhead and Profit\n",
      "\n",
      "Total Cost including O&P for the installing contractor is shown in the last column of the Unit Price and/or Assemblies. This figure is the sum of the bare material cost plus 10% for profit, the bare labor cost plus total overhead and profit, and the bare equipment cost plus 10% for profit. Details for the calculation of overhead and profit on labor are shown on the inside back cover of the printed product and in the Reference Section of the electronic product.\n",
      "\n",
      "### General Conditions\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost data in this data set are presented in two ways: Bare Costs and Total Cost including O&P (Overhead and Profit). General Conditions, or General Requirements, of the contract should also be added to the Total Cost including O&P when applicable. Costs for General Conditions are listed in Division 1 of the Unit Price Section and in the Reference Section.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Conditions for the installing contractor may range from 0% to 10% of the Total Cost including O&P. For the general or prime contractor, costs for General Conditions may range from 5% to 15% of the Total Cost including O&P, with a figure of 10% as the most typical allowance. If applicable, the Assemblies and Models sections use costs that include the installing contractor's overhead and profit (O&P).\n",

      "percentage done by subcontractors is constantly\n",
      "increasing and may run over 90%. Since the\n",

      "Full text: Factors Affecting Costs\n",
      "Costs can vary depending upon a number of\n",
      "variables. Here's a listing of some factors that\n",
      "affect costs and points to consider.\n",
      "Quality-The prices for materials and the\n",
      "workmanship upon which productivity is based\n",
      "represent sound construction work. They are also\n",
      "in line with industry standard and manufacturer\n",
      "specifications and are frequently used by federal,\n",
      "state, and local governments.\n",
      "Overtime-We have made no allowance for\n",
      "overtime. If you anticipate premium time or work\n",
      "beyond normal working hours, be sure to make\n",
      "an appropriate adjustment to your labor costs.\n",
      "Productivity-The productivity, daily output,\n",
      "and labor-hour figures for each line item are\n",
      "based on an eight-hour work day in daylight\n",
      "hours in moderate temperatures and up to a\n",
      "14' working height unless otherwise indicated.\n",
      "For work that extends beyond normal work\n",
      "hours or is performed under adverse conditions,\n",
      "productivity may decrease.\n",
      "Size of Project-The size, scope of work, and type\n",
      "of construction project will have a significant\n",
      "impact on cost. Economies of scale can reduce\n",
      "costs for large projects. Unit costs can often run\n",
      "higher for small projects.\n",
      "Location-Material prices are for metropolitan\n",
      "areas. However, in dense urban areas, traffic\n",
      "and site storage limitations may increase costs.\n",
      "Beyond a 20-mile radius of metropolitan areas,\n",
      "extra trucking or transportation charges may also\n",
      "increase the material costs slightly. On the other\n",
      "hand, lower wage rates may be in effect. Be sure\n",
      "to consider both of these factors when preparing\n",
      "an estimate, particularly if the job site is located\n",
      "in a central city or remote rural location. In\n",
      "addition, highly specialized subcontract items\n",
      "may require travel and per-diem expenses for\n",
      "mechanics.\n",

      "conditions influence \"in-place\" costs of all items.\n",
      "Substitute materials and construction methods\n",
      "may have to be employed. These may affect\n",
      "the installed cost and/or life cycle costs. Such\n",
      "factors may be difficult to evaluate and cannot\n",
      "necessarily be predicted on the basis of the job's\n",
      "location in a particular section of the country.\n",
      "Thus, where these factors apply, you may find\n",
      "significant but unavoidable cost variations\n",
      "for which you will have to apply a measure of\n",
      "judgment to your estimate.\n",
      "Rounding of Costs\n",
      "In printed publications only, all unit prices in\n",
      "excess of $5.00 have been rounded to make\n",
      "them easier to use and still maintain adequate\n",
      "precision of the results.\n",
      "How Subcontracted\n",
      "Items Affect Costs\n",
      "A considerable portion of all large construction\n",
      "jobs is usually subcontracted. In fact, the\n",
      "percentage done by subcontractors is constantly\n",
      "increasing and may run over 90%. Since the\n",
      "workers employed by these companies do\n",
      "nothing else but install their particular products,\n",
      "they soon become experts in that line. As a\n",
      "result, installation by these firms is accomplished\n",
      "so efficiently that the total in-place cost, even\n",
      "with the general contractor's overhead and\n",
      "profit, is no more, and often less, than if the\n",
      "principal contractor had handled the installation.\n",
      "Companies that deal with construction\n",
      "specialties are anxious to have their products\n",
      "perform well and, consequently, the installation\n",
      "will be the best possible.\n",
      "Contingencies\n",
      "The allowance for contingencies generally\n",
      "provides for unforeseen construction difficulties.\n",
      "On alterations or repair jobs, 20% is not too\n",
      "much. If drawings are final and only field\n",
      "contingencies are being considered, 2% or 3%\n",
      "is probably sufficient and often nothing needs\n",
      "to be added. Contractually, changes in plans\n",
      "will be covered by extras. The contractor should\n",
      "consider inflationary price trends and possible\n",
      "material shortages during the course of the job.\n",
      "These escalation factors are dependent upon\n",
      "both economic conditions and the anticipated\n",
      "time between the estimate and actual\n",
      "construction. If drawings are not complete or\n",
      "approved, or a budget cost is wanted, it is wise\n",
      "to add 5% to 10%. Contingencies, then, are a\n",
      "matter of judgment.\n",
      "Important Estimating\n",

      "Factors Affecting Costs  \n",
      "Costs can vary depending upon a number of variables. Here's a listing of some factors that affect costs and points to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Quality** - The prices for materials and the workmanship upon which productivity is based represent sound construction work. They are also in line with industry standard and manufacturer specifications and are frequently used by federal, state, and local governments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overtime** - We have made no allowance for overtime. If you anticipate premium time or work beyond normal working hours, be sure to make an appropriate adjustment to your labor costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Productivity** - The productivity, daily output, and labor-hour figures for each line item are based on an eight-hour work day in daylight hours in moderate temperatures and up to a 14' working height unless otherwise indicated. For work that extends beyond normal work hours or is performed under adverse conditions, productivity may decrease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Size of Project** - The size, scope of work, and type of construction project will have a significant impact on cost. Economies of scale can reduce costs for large projects. Unit costs can often run higher for small projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Location** - Material prices are for metropolitan areas. However, in dense urban areas, traffic and site storage limitations may increase costs. Beyond a 20-mile radius of metropolitan areas, extra trucking or transportation charges may also increase the material costs slightly. On the other hand, lower wage rates may be in effect. Be sure to consider both of these factors when preparing an estimate, particularly if the job site is located in a central city or remote rural location. In addition, highly specialized subcontract items may require travel and per-diem expenses for mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Other Factors**  \n",
      "\" \"  \n",
      "season of year  \n",
      "contractor management  \n",
      "weather conditions  \n",

      "safety requirements  \n",
      "environmental considerations  \n",
      "access\n",
      "\n",
      "**Unpredictable Factors** - General business conditions influence \"in-place\" costs of all items. Substitute materials and construction methods may have to be employed. These may affect the installed cost and/or life cycle costs. Such factors may be difficult to evaluate and cannot necessarily be predicted on the basis of the job's location in a particular section of the country. Thus, where these factors apply, you may find significant but unavoidable cost variations for which you will have to apply a measure of judgment to your estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rounding of Costs**  \n",
      "In printed publications only, all unit prices in excess of $5.00 have been rounded to make them easier to use and still maintain adequate precision of the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How Subcontracted Items Affect Costs**  \n",
      "A considerable portion of all large construction jobs is usually subcontracted. In fact, the percentage done by subcontractors is constantly increasing and may run over 90%. Since the workers employed by these companies do nothing else but install their particular products, they soon become experts in that line. As a result, installation by these firms is accomplished so efficiently that the total in-place cost, even with the general contractor's overhead and profit, is no more, and often less, than if the principal contractor had handled the installation. Companies that deal with construction specialties are anxious to have their products perform well and, consequently, the installation will be the best possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Contingencies**  \n",
      "The allowance for contingencies generally provides for unforeseen construction difficulties. On alterations or repair jobs, 20% is not too much. If drawings are final and only field contingencies are being considered, 2% or 3% is probably sufficient and often nothing needs to be added. Contractually, changes in plans will be covered by extras. The contractor should consider inflationary price trends and possible material shortages during the course of the job. These escalation factors are dependent upon both economic conditions and the anticipated time between the estimate and actual construction. If drawings are not complete or approved, or a budget cost is wanted, it is wise to add 5% to 10%. Contingencies, then, are a matter of judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Estimating Considerations**  \n",
      "The productivity, or daily output, of each craftsman or crew assumes a well-managed job where tradesmen with the proper tools and equipment, along with the appropriate construction materials, are present. Included are daily set-up and cleanup time, break time, and plan layout time. Unless otherwise indicated, time for material movement on site (for items X\n",

      "While horizontal movement is typically a sole function of distances, vertical transport introduces other variables that can significantly impact productivity. In an occupied building, the use of elevators (assuming access, size, and required protective measures are acceptable) must be understood at the time of the estimate. For new construction, hoist wait and cycle times can easily be 15 minutes and may result in scheduled access extending beyond the normal work day. Finally, all vertical transport will impose strict weight limits likely to preclude the use of any motorized material handling.  \n",
      "The productivity, or daily output, also assumes installation that meets manufacturer/designer/standard specifications. A time allowance for quality control checks, minor adjustments, and any task required to ensure proper function or operation is also included. For items that require connections to services, time is included for positioning, leveling, securing the unit, and making all the necessary connections (and start up where applicable) to ensure a complete installation. Estimating of the services themselves (electrical, plumbing, water, steam, hydraulics, dust collection, etc.) is separate.  \n",
      "In some cases, the estimator must consider the use of a crane and an appropriate crew for the installation of large or heavy items. For those situations where a crane is not included in the assigned crew and as part of the line item cost, then equipment rental costs, mobilization and demobilization costs, and operator and support personnel costs must be considered.\n",
